Skeletal dysplasias (also called bone dysplasias) are single gene disorders affecting development and function of the skeleton. The skeleton forms through a complex process called enchondral ossification, in which skeletal elements are first created as cartilage models (‘Anlagen’) which get subsequently replaced by bone. Over 400 different skeletal dysplasias are currently recognised. Every aspect of skeletal development can be affected, resulting in a wide variety of symptoms. The abnormalities can affect the bone tissue itself or its cartilaginous predecessor. Bones can fail to form, fail to grow, or be structurally abnormal, resulting in skeletal deformities and fractures.

Patients with skeletal dysplasias suffer from short stature, early onset arthritis and increased bone fragility.  As the skeleton forms a scaffold around many vital organs, secondary complications, such as respiratory distress due to an underdeveloped rib cage or neurological damage due to compression of the spinal cord are frequent. The common end point is lifelong disability or even premature death. Patients with skeletal dysplasias present some of the most challenging problems in orthopaedic surgery and medicine in general.

While their severity and disabling nature makes skeletal dysplasias worthy of our attention in their own right, they also serve as models for more common musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. A lot of our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these common disorders has come from studying the genetic defects and altered pathophysiology in patients with skeletal dysplasias.

# Areas of Research

## Clinical Research
Through our skeletal dysplasia clinic and our large network of international collaborators, we  identify patients with rare skeletal dysplasias, study their clinical characteristics and natural history, evaluate new treatments and perform clinical trials.
 
## Molecular Genetics and Genomics
We apply Whole Genome Sequencing and other high-throughput -omics technologies to identify genetic variants and novel genes involved in skeletal dysplasias and study their role in bone and cartilage biology.

## Bioinformatics
We are interested in the large scale integration of clinical, genetic and molecular data sets to obtain a systems level view of bone and cartilage biology. A particular focus is Phenomics, the systematic and large scale analysis of clinical (phenotype) data. While bioinformatic methods for the processing of large biological datasets exist, the computational processing of clinical data is still in its infancy. The wide variability of clinical descriptions makes this a challenging area. We apply natural language processing (NLP) to extract data from medical records and the medical literature and use ontologies 
and other knowledge engineering techniques to integrate this data with other biological datasets.
